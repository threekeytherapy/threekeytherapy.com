## About Me

My name is Claus, and I am a certified Manuvision therapist.

I have been working as a therapist since 2022, receiving Manuvision trainings and treatments since 2016, and dabbling with the existential arts since 2006.

I am deeply inspired by Sufi and Buddhist traditions, lucid dreaming, shadow work, dance improvisation, and being open to 'knowledge of self' in whatever form it comes. 

I have a background in political science, with 10 years of experience in helping governments become more open and collaborative.
I have served in various roles - executive, coordinator and facilitator - focused on public software and procurement projects. 
I hold a Belgian passport, grew up across Asia, and speak English, Dutch, Spanish & some French.

## About Manuvision

Manuvision is a community of body therapists with over 25 years of experience in freeing the nervous system from stress and trauma.

Our method is grounded in creating a space of trust and presence, where individuals can embrace vulnerability, feel seen and heard, and find the support they need to overcome their challenges.

Manuvision therapists have been proven to help veterans with PTSD in a peer reviewed study[^1], regularly work with world-class athletes[^2], and support senior political and corporate leaders in becoming more effective and compassionate leaders.

Manuvision integrates a diverse range of traditions, including Chinese traditional medicine, Western physiotherapy, Jungian psychology, shadow work, breathwork, and inner child work.
