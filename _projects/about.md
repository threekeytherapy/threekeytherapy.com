## About Me

My name is Claus, I have a Belgian passport, grew up in Asia, and speak English, Dutch, Spanish and French.

I trained as a body therapist to help shift my focus to what matters most - being alive in whatever precious time there is left.

After dabbling with the existential arts since I was 16, and working within the Manuvision system since 2016, I completed a 2 year intensive training to become a Manuvision therapist.

I am deeply inspired by Sufi and Buddhist traditions, lucid dreaming, shadow work, and open to knowledge of self in whatever form it comes. 

Being fascinated by different perspectives on reality, I've also spent the last 10 years facilitating international collaborations on (open source) software projects for governments.

## About Manuvision

Manuvision is a community of body therapists building on 25 years of research in liberating the nervous system. 

We work by creating a space of trust and presence in which people can open up to vulnerability, be seen and heard, and feel supported to overcome their struggle.

Manuvision therapists have been proven to help soldiers with PTSD in clinical studies, work alongside world leading and Olympic athletes, and support senior political and corporate leaders in becoming better leaders. 

Manuvision draws from Chinese traditional medicine, Western physiotherapy, Jungian psychology and shadow work, breathwork, inner child work, as well as various other traditions.
