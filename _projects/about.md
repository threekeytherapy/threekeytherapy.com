My name is Claus and I am a certified Manuvision therapist.

I have been working as a therapist since 2022, receiving Manuvision trainings and treatments since 2016, and generally dabbling with the existential arts since 2006.

I am deeply inspired by Sufi and Buddhist traditions, lucid dreaming, shadow work, dance improvisation, and being open to 'knowledge of self' in whatever form it comes. 

I have a background in political science and 10 years of experience in helping governments become more open and collaborative - as an executive, coordinator and facilitator in public software and public procurement projects.

Whether it's individual therapy, group workshops, or institutional reform, I work to open up spaces for vulnerable exchange, mutual understanding and compassion, and better thus collaboration.

I have a Belgian passport, grew up across Asia, and speak English, Dutch, Spanish & some French.

## About Manuvision

Manuvision is a community of body therapists building on 25 years of research in liberating the nervous system 

We work by creating a space of trust and presence in which people can open up to vulnerability, be seen and heard, and feel supported to overcome their struggle.

Manuvision therapists have been proven to help soldiers with PTSD in clinical studies, work alongside world leading and Olympic athletes, and support senior political and corporate leaders in becoming better leaders. 

Manuvision draws from Chinese traditional medicine, Western physiotherapy, Jungian psychology and shadow work, breathwork, inner child work, as well as various other traditions.
