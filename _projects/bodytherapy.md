The body remembers the life it has lived.
Each experience leaves a trace, remembered by the body, conditioning the mind.

Manuvision body therapy is a form of treatment that addresses physical and psychological disorders through the body. 
We release the tension behind the body's symptoms, create balance in the nervous system, and kickstart the body's natural healing processes.
Working with your nervous system you can release old physical tensions, integrate unprocessed emotions, and let go of unhelpful subconscious reflexes.

Unblocking your body, you unblock your mind - untangling yourself from worn-out narratives, sticky thought loops, and toxic behaviour patterns.

In English, Dutch, Spanish, and rusty French.

## How it works

Body and psyche are connected.

If there is pain in the body, it affects the psyche, and if you are under psychological pressure, it settles in the body.
It is always the body that first draws attention to the fact that something is wrong.
And it is the body that suffers the consequences of all our actions – or lack thereof.
These consequences manifest as tension, blockages and thus pain in our body.

Manuvision body therapy helps you break free.
We do this by opening the body and loosening the tensions and blockages that lie behind the physical and psychological ailments.

The many impressions and expressions of the past and everyday life are stored in the body.
Your body depicts your mental well-being – and the physical and the psyche are thus not two separate elements, but a whole.
That connection has a direct connection to our nervous system, and it is also one of the reasons why Manuvision body therapy works through the nervous system.

During a body therapy treament, I will work with you to:

* create balance in your nervous system
* opening up the breathing
* activate flow in the body's energy system
* relax muscles, release joints and loosen up the neck and back from a combination of deep massage techniques, joint release, acupressure and zone points
* read and remedy disturbances in the nervous system that can result in everything from digestive problems and neck tension to stress , anxiety and depression
* create a connection between the head's narratives and the body's signals by examining the connection between mental, physical and emotional states

When there is flow and movement, the body's own self-healing processes are automatically set in motion.

I do this to try keep care accessible to as many people as possible.
If this is not within your range, please contact me and we can find a solution.

### What to wear

Treatments involve touch, and the nervous system responds most to skin contact.
For this reason, treatments work best without big items of clothing.
I recommend wearing underwear that is not revealing and a sports bra.
If you are not comfortable with this, it is of course possible to treat with clothing.
