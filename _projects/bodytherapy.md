## Address your symptoms at the root

Most emotional, psychological, and physical disorders are caused by subconscious tension in the body.

During a session, we can work together to release these tensions at their root, by freeing the nervous system.
This involves a combination of touch, breathing and conversation.

## Why work with the nervous system?

Each experience leaves a trace, remembered by the body, conditioning the mind.

Body and mind are deeply interconnected.
If there is pain in the body, it affects the psyche, and if you are under psychological pressure, it settles in the body.
Your body depicts your mental well-being – the physical and the psyche are not two separate elements, but a whole.

It is always the body that first draws attention to the fact that something is wrong.
And it is the body that suffers the consequences of all our actions – or lack thereof.
These consequences manifest as tension, blockages and thus pain in our body.

The nervous system is where these two connect, which is one of the reasons why Manuvision body therapy works through the nervous system.

## What can I expect in a session?

During a therapy session I will work with you to open the body and loosening the tensions and blockages that lie behind the physical and psychological ailments. 
This can include:

### Relieve Tensions

Use deep massage techniques, joint release, acupressure, and zone points to relax muscles, release joints, and ease neck and back tension.

### Restore Nervous System Balance

Remedy disturbances that can cause issues like digestive problems, neck tension, stress, anxiety, and depression.

### Connect Mind and Body

Explore the relationship between the head's narratives and the body's signals by examining the connection between mental, physical and emotional states

### Activate Self-healing Processes

Create balance in your nervous system, open up the breathing, and activate flow in the body's energy system.
When there is flow and movement, the body's own self-healing processes are automatically set in motion.

### What to Wear

Treatments involve touch, and the nervous system responds best to skin contact.
For this reason, treatments work best without big items of clothing.
I recommend wearing underwear that is not revealing and a sports bra.
If you are not comfortable with this, it is of course possible to receive a treatment with clothing.
