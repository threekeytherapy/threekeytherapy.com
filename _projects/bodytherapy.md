> The body remembers the life it has lived.

Body and psyche are connected.
The many impressions and expressions of the past and everyday life are stored in the body.
Your body depicts your mental well-being – the physical and the psyche are not two separate elements, but a whole.

If there is pain in the body, it affects the psyche, and if you are under psychological pressure, it settles in the body.

It is always the body that first draws attention to the fact that something is wrong.
And it is the body that suffers the consequences of all our actions – or lack thereof.
These consequences manifest as tension, blockages and thus pain in our body.

That connection has a direct connection to our nervous system, and it is also one of the reasons why Manuvision body therapy works through the nervous system.

> Manuvision body therapy helps you break free

We do this by opening the body and loosening the tensions and blockages that lie behind the physical and psychological ailments.

During a body therapy treament, I will work with you to:

* relax muscles, release joints and loosen up the neck and back from a combination of deep massage techniques, joint release, acupressure and zone points
* read and remedy disturbances in the nervous system that can result in everything from digestive problems and neck tension to stress , anxiety and depression
* create a connection between the head's narratives and the body's signals by examining the connection between mental, physical and emotional states

This helps to create balance in your nervous system, open up the breathing, and activate flow in the body's energy system.

When there is flow and movement, the body's own self-healing processes are automatically set in motion
