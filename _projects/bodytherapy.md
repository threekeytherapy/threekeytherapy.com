## Why work with the nervous system?

Each experience leaves a trace, remembered by the body, conditioning the mind.

The body and mind are deeply interconnected.
If there is pain in the body, it affects the psyche; and if you are under psychological pressure, it manifests in the body.
Your body reflects your mental well-being – the physical and mental are not two separate elements, but one whole.

The body is always the first to signal that something is wrong.
And the body also suffers the consequences of all our actions – or lack thereof.
These consequences manifest as tension, blockages, and pain in the body.

The nervous system is where the body and mind connect, which is one of the reasons why Manuvision body therapy works through the nervous system.

## What can I expect in a session?

During a therapy session we work together with a combination of touch, breathing, and conversation to release the tensions and blockages underlying your physical and psychological symptoms.

This may include:

- **Relieve Tensions**: Use deep massage techniques, joint release, acupressure, and zone points to relax muscles, release joints, and ease neck and back tension.  
- **Restore Nervous System Balance**:  Address disturbances that can cause issues such as digestive problems, neck tension, stress, anxiety, and depression.  
- **Connect Mind and Body**: Explore the relationship between mental narratives and the body’s signals by examining the connection between mental, physical, and emotional states.  
- **Activate Self-healing Processes**: Balance your nervous system, open your breathing, and activate the flow in your body’s energy system. When there is flow and movement, your body’s natural self-healing processes are set in motion.

**What to Wear**

Treatments involve touch, and the nervous system responds best to direct skin contact.
For this reason, treatments are most effective with minimal clothing.
I recommend wearing non-revealing underwear and a sports bra.
If you are not comfortable with this, it is of course possible to receive a treatment with clothing.
