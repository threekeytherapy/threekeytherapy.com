> What people have said

"I feel like more has happened in one session than my past year of doing talk therapy. It made me realise just how important the body is for the healing process. It's more direct, there is less bullshit." -  **Naomi, 29, environmental activist**

"A friend of mine recommended I see Claus for neck pains that I have been having since a whiplash during a bicylce accident last year. He was able to address my neck much more gently than the chiropractors I tried which was very nice. What surprised me, is that we ended up working on the pain I felt as a child when my parents divorced, something I didn't even realise I carried. I am very grateful for this! Life feels lighter and I smile more." - **Niels, 42, financial analyst**

"Claus is like a facilitator for vulnerability - I feel I can really open up to myself. My own anger, my own sadness and grief." - **Conti, 34, researcher**

"Ik vind met Claus werken echt fantastich, heb al de helft van mijn vriendenkring doorgestuurd. Ik weet niet hoe hij het doet, maar ik hoor van iedereen dat ze heel tevreden zijn - voor uiteenlopende dingen. Zelf maak ik dat ik zeker eens om de 2-3 maand binnenspring voor onderhoud" - **Femke, 48, administrative assistant**
