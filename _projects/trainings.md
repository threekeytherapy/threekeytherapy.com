Manuvision trainings combine elements from body therapy, reflexology, traditional karate, and yoga to open up the body and mind.

There is a strong emphasis on grounding, becoming more aware how you handle limits, escape or face internal resistance, and can move from a deeper presence.

Trainings typically include losening all the main joints in the body, opening up core meridian lines, a bit of cardio, body awareness training and some stretching.

We usually close with a small sharing circle.
