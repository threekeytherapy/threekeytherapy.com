During treatments I use massage techniques to surface your subconscious physical tensions, along with their underlying psycho-emotional causes - whether unprocessed stress, anxiety, fear, anger, sadness, ...

Once surfaced, you have the opportunity to work with your breathing, mind and nervous system to let go of these old tensions, as well as the restrictive thoughts, feelings and behaviour patterns associated with them.

Treatments will help you feel relaxed and present in your body, with a clearer mind, and more able to fully enjoy life and navigate change.

Or feel a sudden desire to sign up to a pottery course and start wearing purple ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

### Working languages

I regularly work in English, Dutch and Spanish.
I can also work in rusty French.

### Pricing

I work with solidarity prices.

This means you can pay any amount between 70 and 120 euros, based on your financial situation.

I do this to try keep care accessible to as many people as possible.
If this is not within your range, please contact me and we can find a solution.

### What to wear

Treatments involve touch, and the nervous system responds most to skin contact.
For this reason, treatments work best without big items of clothing.
I recommend wearing underwear that is not revealing and a sports bra.
If you are not comfortable with this, it is of course possible to treat with clothing.
