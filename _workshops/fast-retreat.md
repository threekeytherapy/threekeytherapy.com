## Introduction

A Manuvision fast offers a deep reset for both your body and mind.

You'll experience a sense of freedom, renewed energy, and personal growth by challenging your body’s habits, exploring its potential, and unlocking its natural ability to heal and regenerate.

The fast will be lead by [Steffen Lundgaard](https://manuvision.es/en/steffen-en/), who has been facilitating fast retreats for over 15 years.

## Overview

- **10 days** of a preparatory diet at home  
- **4-day retreat** in a serene farmhouse surrounded by nature  
- **10 days** of post-fasting dietary guidance at home  

## Diet

Before and after the retreat, you'll follow a tailored diet with specific restrictions (a detailed list will be provided).

During the 4-day retreat, only water (and occasional herbal tea) will be consumed. On the final day, we will break the fast together with a nourishing bowl of soup.

## Retreat programme

- **Day 1:** Arrival day – a quiet, peaceful time to settle in. You’ll begin the water-only fast.
- **Days 2 & 3:** Full, active days dedicated to physical training, stretching, and bodywork, designed to cleanse and energize each organ. You'll also have opportunities for nature walks, swimming, and enjoying the sauna.
- **Day 4:** The completion of the fast is celebrated with a bowl of soup, and you'll return home.

## Online support groups

We offer online support before and after the retreat, where you can connect with others, ask questions, and share your experiences. These peer-to-peer gatherings ensure ongoing support and a sense of community throughout your journey.
