> It takes 3 days until the last thing you consumed leaves your body. Without a longer fast, your organs do not **ever** get the chance to fully rest.

## A deep reset for both your body and mind

A Manuvision fast combines 20 days of cleansing diet with a 3 day fasting retreat, including extensive body work, training and massage.

The fast will be led by [Steffen Lundgaard](https://manuvision.es/en/steffen-en/), who has been facilitating fast retreats for over 15 years.

## An opportunity to work on mind, body and emotions

This fast aims to let every organ rest, with each day's activities focusing on caring for the organs that reach rest on that particular day.

### Physically, the fast helps to:
- Improve circulation
- Sharpen the senses
- Detoxify organs, flush out years of built-up waste
- Reset and regulate metabolism
- Unlock the body's natural ability to heal and regenerate

### Emotionally, the fast is an invitation to feel yourself:
- Without habitual escape patterns (tobacco, coffee, sugar, snacking, ...)
- With less expendable energy, becoming aware of how much your 'mask' (ie personality of being funny, helpful to others, smart and calm, etc) starts to cost, and what it means to take this off
- Surrendering to being in the group simply as yourself (whether grumpy, tired, sad or angry)

This increased vulnerability makes for a beautiful, honest and open group dyanmic with fantastic sharings

### Mentally, the fast is an opportunity to:
- Learn about the functioning of your organs, related muscle groups and meridian systems
- Understand and reflect on your habit patterns
- Experience a deep sense of self-awareness and freedom, with renewed energy

### Removing old blockages and imbalances can help recover from various issues including, for example:
- Sleep and digestive disorders
- Long-standing infections
- Anxiety, indecision and depression
- Skin conditions
- Improved vision and reduced eye strain
- Reduced intensity of autoimmune diseases

What it can do really depends on what is blocked in your system.

## Practical

### Overview

- **10 days** of pre-fasting preparatory diet at home  
- **3-day retreat** in a serene farmhouse surrounded by nature  
- **10 days** of post-fasting diet at home  

### Diet

Before and after the retreat, you'll follow a tailored diet with specific restrictions (a detailed list will be provided).

During the 3-day retreat, only water (and occasional herbal tea) will be consumed.

On the final day, we will break the fast together with a nourishing bowl of soup.

### Retreat schedule

- **3 April:** Conference call with all participants with preparatory instructions and setting up online support groups.
- **28 April to 7 May:** Preparatory diet 
- **8 May:** You'll begin the water-only fast. We will gather at the venue in the afternoon/evening and settle in (you can arrive any time after 14:00).
- **9 and 10 May:** Full, active days dedicated to physical training, stretching, and bodywork - designed to cleanse and energize each organ. There will be opportunities for nature walks, swimming, and enjoying the sauna.
- **11 May:** Morning with active sessions, and a bowl of soup for lunch to celebrate the completion of the fast. We'll finish up and be ready to leave around 14:00.
- **12 -21 May:** Post-fast diet  (the hardest part!) 
- **28 May:** Optional conference call with a space to share reflections and learnings.

### Online support groups

We offer online support before and after the retreat, where you can connect with others, ask questions, and share your experiences.
These peer-to-peer gatherings ensure ongoing support and a sense of community throughout your journey.

### Venue

The 2025 fast will take place at De Uelenspieghel, Winkelsteeg 5, 7975 PV Uffelte, Netherlands.
