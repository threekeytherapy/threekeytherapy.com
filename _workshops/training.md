## Manuvision Training: Bringing You Back into Your Body

It combines traditional karate, yoga, and reflexology with body therapy's knowledge of the how muscle tension, energy pathways and emotions are connected.

We work on the whole body—focusing on muscles, connective tissue, breathing, circulation, and the main joints—while improving overall strength and flexibility.

We also emphasize presence and awareness, with a strong focus on grounding.
This helps you become more aware of how you handle limits, whether you escape or face internal resistance, and allows you to move from a deeper place of presence.

Training sessions usually conclude with a brief sharing circle.

## Manuvision training as self-treatment

In a therapy treatment, you get help from the outside to work with your tensions.
In training, you learn to do this work yourself, enabling you to maintain your body and prevent injuries.

This means trainings help you:
* address the contractions that cause tension and pain
* practice deep, free breathing, which helps release stress and muscle tension
* train the nervous system and the ability to alternate between being calm and alert
* confront the places where we collapse because we lack strength in muscles and joints

In this way, Manuvision training complements body therapy. It allows you to work directly with the underlying tensions behind the physical and psychological issues for which you seek treatment.
